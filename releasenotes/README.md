# Salesforce CLI Release Notes

We've made a few changes to the Salesforce CLI release notes.

As of October 7, 2021, Salesforce CLI is a bundle of two executables: `sf` and `sfdx`. The `sfdx` executable is the one you know and love and have been using to build applications on Salesforce Platform. We're introducting `sf` to bring together a cross-cloud set of commands that streamline how you build and deploy across _all_ Salesforce clouds and brands. Pretty exciting stuff, huh.  

For simplicity, each executable has its own set of release notes:

* [sfdx Release Notes](sfdx/README.md): As always, the `sfdx` executable releases a new version and release candidate every Thursday.
* [sf Release Notes](sf/README.md): The `sf` executable will release a new version as needed. 

Enjoy!
