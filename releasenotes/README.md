# Salesforce CLI Release Notes

We've made a few changes to the Salesforce CLI release notes.

As of October 7, 2021, Salesforce CLI is a bundle of two executables: `sf` and `sfdx`. The `sfdx` executable is the one you know and love and have been using to build applications on Salesforce Platform. We're introducing `sf` to bring together a cross-cloud set of commands that streamline how you build and deploy across _all_ Salesforce clouds and brands. Exciting stuff, huh.  

Because each executable has its own version, we're also keeping their release notes separate:

* [sfdx Release Notes](sfdx/README.md)
* [sf Release Notes](sf/README.md) 

Both executables release a new version and release candidate every Thursday. 

Enjoy!
