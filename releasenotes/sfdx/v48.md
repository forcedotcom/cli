# Salesforce CLI v48 Release Notes

Here are the new and changed features in recent updates of Salesforce CLI and the `salesforcedx` plug-in.

Run `sfdx version` to display the version of Salesforce CLI installed on your computer. Run `sfdx plugins --core` to display the version of the installed `salesforcedx` plug-in.

Run `sfdx update` to update both the CLI and the `salesforcedx` plug-in to the latest available version.

If you use [autocomplete](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_cli_autocomplete.htm), run `sfdx autocomplete --refresh-cache` after you update the `salesforcedx` plug-in to ensure that autocomplete works correctly on any new commands.

## 48.22.11 (July 15, 2020)
* FIX: We fixed a regression with source tracking for projects with bundled metadata types. ([GitHub issue #480 ](../../../issues/480 ))
* CHANGE: We've upgraded the CLI's version of Node.js to 12.13.0.

## 48.22.8 (July 14, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed a regression with multiple package directory listings in `sfdx-project.json` that point to the same path. ([GitHub issue #468 ](../../../issues/468 ))
* FIX: We fixed a regression with running `force:mdapi:convert` with `--outputdir`. ([GitHub issue #471 ](../../../issues/471 ))

## 48.22.4 (July 12, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed a regression with `force:source:deploy` using the `--json` and `--wait 0` parameters returning the wrong type. ([GitHub issue #472](../../../issues/472))

## 48.22.2 (July 9, 2020)

* NEW: We introduced two new commands to override how the CLI tracks your local source code. The commands work with any org that supports source tracking. 

  * `force:source:tracking:reset`. Resets local and remote source tracking so that the CLI doesn't register current differences between your local files and metadata in the org. When you next run `force:source:status`, the CLI returns no results, even if conflicts actually exist. The CLI then resumes tracking new source changes as usual. 
  
    The main use case is when the CLI doesn't have any tracking history for an org. For example, you want to use an org that's pre-populated by an automated process with the same metadata that's in your VCS. Run this command to make the CLI behave as if the local and remote files are the same at the moment you run the command.

  * `force:source:tracking:clear`. Clears all local source tracking information. When you next run `force:source:status`, the CLI displays all local and remote files as changed, and any files with the same name are listed as conflicts. You manually resolve these conflicts yourself by, for example, forcing a push or pull. The CLI then resumes tracking new source changes as usual. 

    Salesforce Customer Support uses this command to diagnose issues. We don't recommend using this command in your normal work flow.

    **WARNING**: These commands delete or modify all existing local source tracking files in your project and affect subsequent behavior of the `force:source` commands. For example, if you reset source tracking then run `force:source:pull`, the CLI can silently overwrite local files even if there's actually a conflict. Use the commands only if you understand the differences between your local source files and the metadata in your org. And use extreme caution. Really. 

* CHANGE: You can use the `force:source:push` and `force:source:pull` commands on metadata files stored in multiple package directories instead of just the default package directory. Multiple package directories help you organize your local source code into logical units. ([GitHub issue #379](../../../issues/379))

    Each package directory must adhere to the standard [Salesforce DX project structure](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_source_file_format.htm). List the package directories in your `sfdx-project.json` file in the order you want the packaged metadata deployed to your org.  

    Documentation about working with multiple package directories will be available in the [Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_workspace_setup.htm) around July 15, 2020. 

* CHANGE:  We've improved the output of the `commands` command. By default, the command displays the full list of CLI commands and their descriptions in table format. With the new parameters, you can display more columns, such as command usage and the plug-in it belongs to. You have more choices for the output format (`.csv`, `.json`, `.yaml`). You can also filter and sort the output. The `commands` command works the same as the [oclif command](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-commands#oclif-example-commands).  

* FIX: You can run `force:source:push` after deleting a report that begins with the letter D in an org. Previously the push returned an error such as `ERROR running force:source:push: SourceMember WHERE MemberName IN ('unfiled$public\Demo_time_per_lead_1Yb'`. ([GitHub issue #221](../../../issues/221))


## 48.21.0 (July 2, 2020)

* We aren't releasing a Salesforce CLI patch this week. 

## 48.20.0 (June 25, 2020)

* We aren't releasing a Salesforce CLI patch this week. 
* As we described in this [blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2020/05/open-sourcing-salesforce-cli.html), we've open-sourced the Salesforce CLI release notes and moved them to this GitHub repository.

Join us at [TrailheadDX 2020](https://www.salesforce.com/trailheadx/) to find out what's new in Salesforce developer tooling. 

## 48.19.0 (June 18, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed some under-the-hood bugs.

## 48.18.1 (June 11, 2020)

* NEW: We introduced a new topic (`cmdt`) and five new commands in this topic for managing custom metadata types.

   * `force:cmdt:create`. Creates a custom metadata type in the current project.
   * `force:cmdt:field:create`. Generates a custom metadata field based on the provided field type.
   * `force:cmdt:generate`. Generates a custom metadata type and all its records for the provided sObject.
   * `force:cmdt:record:create`. Creates a record for a given custom metadata type in the current project.
   * `force:cmdt:record:insert`. Creates custom metadata type records from a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

To learn more about custom metadata types, read our [documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=custommetadatatypes_overview.htm).

## 48.17.0 (June 4, 2020)

* FIX: We've improved the error message when running `force:source:deploy` and your manifest file (`package.xml`) contains an incorrect entry for the Workflow or WorkflowFieldUpdate metadata type. An example of an incorrect entry is a reference to a local file that doesn't exist. The command now prompts you to review your `package.xml` file for user errors. Previously it returned the error `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`. ([GitHub issue #280](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli/issues/280))

## 48.16.2 (May 28, 2020)

* FIX: The ExperienceBundle metadata type works correctly when running `force:mdapi:convert`.  The [E-Bikes Lightning Web Components Sample Application](https://github.com/trailheadapps/ebikes-lwc) no longer throws this error:

   ```bash
   ERROR running force:mdapi:convert:  Expected content file(s) at path(s): /Users/jdoe/sfdx/ebikes-lwc/converted/experiences/E_Bikes1.site
   ```

* FIX: The `force:org:list` command displays correct information immediately after you run `force:org:create` to create a scratch org. In particular, we display correct alias information and no longer display refresh tokens.
* FIX: The `force:user:display` command correctly displays the user's plain text password rather than its hashed value. ([GitHub issue #417](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli/issues/417))

## 48.15.0 (May 21, 2020)

* CHANGE: We aren't able to calculate code coverage for the `force:package:version:list` and `force:package:version:report` commands. We're working on a fix and will tell you when that feature is available again.

## 48.14.3 (May 14, 2020)

* FIX: We've standardized character encoding across the `force:mdapi:retrieve` and `force:source:retrieve` results sets. You'll now see apostrophes displayed as `&amp;apos`.
* FIX: Running `force:user:display -u | --targetusername` automatically refreshes an expired token and displays a new one.
* FIX: Running `force:data:record:update -t | --usetoolingapi` successfully updates the record.

## 48.13.1 (May 7, 2020)

* FIX: The `force:org:list` command no longer throws unexpected errors.

## 48.12.0 (April 30, 2020)

* NEW: We added a parameter, `--skipconnectionstatus`, to the `force:org:list` command. Use this parameter to remove the Connected Status column from the org list output and to improve performance.

## 48.11.0 (April 23, 2020)

* We aren't releasing a Salesforce CLI patch this week.

## 48.10.1 (April 16, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed some under-the-hood bugs.

## 48.9.0 (April 9, 2020)

* We aren't releasing a Salesforce CLI patch this week.

## 48.8.0 (April 2, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed some under-the-hood bugs.

## 48.7.0 (March 26, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed some under-the-hood bugs.

## 48.6.0 (March 19, 2020)

* We aren't releasing a Salesforce CLI patch this week.

## 48.5.1 (March 12, 2020)

* FIX: When running `force:data:record:update`, you can update a date field to a null value.
* FIX: Apex unit test failures appear in the output when you run `force:source:deploy --testlevel`.

## 48.4.1 (March 5, 2020)

* NEW: We added a `package.json` file to the standard and analytics Salesforce DX templates. To create these templates, run `force:project:create --template=standard`  or `force:project:create --template=analytics`.
* CHANGE: We are deprecating `force:doc:commands:list` and `force:doc:commands:display`. We will remove these commands in v49.0. Instead, run `sfdx commands`, which produces similar output.
* FIX: We fixed `force:user:create --json` so it works as expected when assigning `permsets`.

## 48.3.1 (February 27, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed some under-the-hood bugs.

## 48.2.0 (February 20, 2020)

* NEW: We introduced three new commands to offer you Lightning Web Components test functionality.

   * `force:lightning:lwc:test:create`. Creates a Lightning Web Components test with boilerplate code inside a `__tests__` directory.
   * `force:lightning:lwc:test:setup`. Installs Jest unit testing tools for Lightning Web Components.
   * `force:lightning:lwc:test:run`. Invokes Lightning Web Components Jest unit tests.

   To learn more about testing Lightning Web Components, read our [documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/48.0/lwc/lwc.testing).

* FIX: When deploying source with the `-c | --checkonly` flag, errors once again display to the console.

## 48.1.5 (February 18, 2020)

* FIX: We fixed the `npm install sfdx-cli` error. ([Github issue #304](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli/issues/304)).

## 48.1.4 (February 17, 2020)

* FIX: Deployments to production using `force:mdapi:deploy` or `force:source:deploy` complete as expected. ([Github issue #305](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli/issues/305)).

## 48.1.2 (February 15, 2020)

Welcome to the first release of version 48 of the `salesforcedx` CLI plug-in in Spring '20.

* CHANGE: Now all JSON output will be sent to `stdout`. Over a year ago we introduced an environment variable, `SFDX_JSON_TO_STDOUT`, to move all JSON output to `stdout` when `true`. This functionality is now the default. If you rely on parsing errors from `stderr` when using `--json`, update your tools and scripts to `stdout` or set `SFDX_JSON_TO_STDOUT` to `false`. You can expect more warnings and errors to be sent to `stderr` even with `--json` set. Learn more about this change in our [blog post.](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2020/02/using-salesforce-cli-output-and-scripting.html?utm_campaign=February_2020&amp;utm_source=release_notes&amp;utm_medium=)

### Installation Notes

We're still working on creating `salesforcedx` v48 installers. However, you can easily update Salesforce CLI to v48 by running `sfdx update` or any CLI command. If you are installing Salesforce CLI for the first time, see [Install Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm#sfdx_setup_install_cli) to install the CLI for your operating system, then run `sfdx update`.

### Uninstall the Pre-Release Version of the `salesforcedx` CLI Plug-In

If you installed the pre-release version 48 of the `salesforcedx` plug-in, uninstall it, then run the update command.

```bash
sfdx plugins:uninstall salesforcedx
sfdx update
```

### New Commands

* `force:analytics:template:create`. Allows you to create a simple analytics template in a specified directory.
* `force:community:create`. Creates a community using a template.
* `force:community:publish`. Publishes your Lightning community to make it live. Each time you publish, you update the live community with the most recent updates.
* `force:community:template:list`. Retrieves the list of templates available in your org for creating a community.

### New Parameters

* `force:package:version:create --skipvalidation`. Skips validation during package version creation. Skipping validation allows you to create package versions faster, but you can’t promote a package version that was created without validation.
* `force:source:delete --checkonly`. Performs a test deployment (validation) in the non-sourced-tracked org without deleting the metadata. After the validation passes, you can safely delete the metadata using this command.

### Changed Commands

* `force:package:version:list`. Displays columns that indicate if the package version has passed code coverage, and the code coverage percentage. We also added columns to indicate the ancestor ID and ancestor version number for the package version's ancestor. Ancestor ID and version number display for package versions created in Spring '20 and later.

### Changed Parameters

These parameters were added to the `force:source:convert` and `force:mdapi:convert` commands in a weekly release of `salesforcedx`.

* `-x | --manifest`. Specifies the complete path to the manifest (`package.xml`) file that specifies the metadata types to convert.
* `-m | --metadata`. Specifies a comma-separated list of metadata component names to convert.
* `-p | --sourcepath`. Specifies a comma-separated list of paths to the local source files to convert (`force:source:convert`).
* `-p | --metadatapath`. Specifies a comma-separated list of paths to the local source files to convert (`force:mdapi:convert`).

### Deprecated Parameters

We removed the `-a` short version of the `--apiversion` parameter. The following commands were affected:

* `force:apex:class:create`
* `force:apex:trigger:create`
* `force:lightning:app:create`
* `force:lightning:component:create`
* `force:lightning:event:create`
* `force:lightning:interface:create`
* `force:visualforce:component:create`
* `force:visualforce:page:create`
