# Salesforce CLI Release Notes (sf Commands)

Here are the new and changed features in recent updates of the `sf` executable of Salesforce CLI.

We publish a new stable version of `sf` on Wednesday; this version is installed automatically when you install or update `sfdx`. At the same time we also publish an `sf` release candidate that contains changes that we plan to include in next week's `sf` release.

Run `sf version` to display the version installed on your computer. Run `sfdx update` to update to the latest available stable version. 

Run `sfdx update stable-rc` to update to the release candidate for both `sf` and `sfdx`. To return to the stable version, run `sfdx update stable`.

## 1.2.0 (Nov 4, 2021)

## 1.1.5 (Oct 28, 2021)

* FIX: We fixed some under-the-hood bugs.

## 1.1.0 (Oct 21, 2021) 

* FIX: We fixed some under-the-hood bugs.

## 1.0.4 (Oct 7, 2021)

Welcome to the first GA release of the new `sf` executable of Salesforce CLI!

Salesforce CLI is a bundle of two executables: `sf` and `sfdx`. We first launched `sfdx` for you to develop and test your apps more easily on Salesforce Platform. But if you want to work across all Salesforce clouds, `sfdx` doesnâ€™t provide all the commands you need. With `sf`, we're bringing together a cross-cloud set of commands that streamline how you build and deploy across Salesforce. See [Get Started with CLI Unification](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_sf_intro.htm) for more information about the `sf` executable, such as how it works with `sfdx`, a mapping of the available `sf` commands to their equivalent `sfdx` commands, and more. 

### Installation Notes

If you've already installed Salesforce CLI and are using `sfdx` commands, update the CLI to the latest version to also get `sf`:

    sfdx update

NOTE: If you haven't already, [uninstall the old `salesforcedx` plug-in](../sfdx/README.md#71063-june-17-2021) to ensure the update succeeds.

Verify that you can use `sf` by running the `help` command, which lists the version and top-level topics:

    sf help

You can also install `sf` with npm:

    npm install @salesforce/cli --global

See [Install sf](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_sf_install.htm) for other installation options and troubleshooting information.

### Documentation

We've enhanced the command-line help to include additional information. As a result, the help can get long, so we've also changed the behavior of the flags:

* `-h` : Displays a subset of the full help: short command and flag descriptions and command usage. Great for quick reference. 
* `--help` : Displays the `-h` content plus longer command and flag descriptions, examples, and the configuration and environment variables that affect the command. 

As far as the online documentation:

* The [Salesforce CLI Command Reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_top.htm) contains reference information about both `sf` and `sfdx` commands.
* For now, the [Salesforce DX Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm) continues to use only the `sfdx` executable in its examples. 
* The [Salesforce CLI Setup Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_sf_intro.htm) contains all the online information about `sf` in a new Get Started section.
