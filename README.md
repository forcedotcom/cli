# A note on CLI Unification

We recently introduced a new executable `sf` to Salesforce CLI. This is the realization of our strategy to unify our developer tooling across all Salesforce clouds and brands. See [Get Started with CLI Unification](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_sf_intro.htm) for more information.

The release notes for both executables (`sf` and `sfdx`) are maintained in [this repo](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli/tree/main/releasenotes).
