# A note on CLI Unification

We recently introduced a new executable, sf, to the Salesforce CLI. This is the realization of our strategy to unify our developer tooling across all Salesforce clouds and brands. Please see our_[Getting Started Guide](link to getting stared guide) for CLI Unification for more information 

For bugs and feature requests for sf please submit them directly to the sf repo _[here](https://github.com/salesforcecli/cli). This will allow our teams to keep these issues organized. We of course will continue to monitor this repo for new issues about sfdx. 

sf release notes will also be in this repository found under release notes
