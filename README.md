# A note on CLI Unification

On July 2023 we [announced the General Availability (GA)](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2023/07/salesforce-cli-sf-v2-is-here) of `sf` (v2), which is the culmination of our CLI unification efforts, which started back in 2021 with [`sf` (v1)](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2021/06/announcing-salesforce-cli-unification). `sf` (v2) is smart enough to understand both `sfdx` and `sf` commands, and due to its smaller size, it's faster to install and update. For more information see:

* [Move from `sfdx` (v7) to `sf` (v2)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_move_to_sf_v2.htm) 
* [Migrate `sfdx`-Style Commands to the New `sf`-Style](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_migrate.htm)
