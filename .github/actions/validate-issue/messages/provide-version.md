Hello @THE_USER :wave: It looks like you did not include the full version information in your issue.
Please provide the output of `version --verbose --json` for the CLI you are using.

A few more things to double check:

- Ensure you have provided detailed steps to reproduce the issue
  - A repository that clearly demonstrates the bug is ideal
- Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI installed ([docs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_update_cli.htm))
  - Better yet, try the `rc` or `nightly` versions ([docs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli_rc.htm))
- Try running the `doctor` command to diagnose common issues
- Search Github for existing related issues

Thank you!
