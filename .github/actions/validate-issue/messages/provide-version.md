Hello @THE_AUTHOR :wave: It looks like you didn't include the full Salesforce CLI version information in your issue.
Please provide the output of `version --verbose --json` for the CLI you're using (`sf` or `sfdx`).

A few more things to check:

- Make sure you've provided detailed steps to reproduce your issue.
  - A repository that clearly demonstrates the bug is ideal.
- Make sure you've installed the latest version of Salesforce CLI. ([docs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_update_cli.htm))
  - Better yet, try the `rc` or `nightly` versions. ([docs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli_rc.htm))
- Try running the `doctor` command to diagnose common issues.
- Search GitHub for existing related issues.

Thank you!
