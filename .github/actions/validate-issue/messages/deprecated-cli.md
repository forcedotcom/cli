Hello @THE_AUTHOR :wave:

It looks like you're using an outdated version of Salesforce CLI. OLD_CLI is in "maintenance mode" as of July 12, 2023. We highly recommend you move from OLD_CLI to `sf` (v2) ASAP.

Moving to `sf` (v2) is easy and takes just two commands. Find all the information [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_move_to_sf_v2.htm).

After you move to the latest version of `sf` (v2), run your command again and provide the output of `sf version --verbose --json`.
